## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open the `.cs` file in your editor (like Visual Studio or VS Code).
2. Make sure you have [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed.
3. Run it via terminal:

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

    Or compile and run:

    ```bash
    dotnet build
    bin/Debug/netX.X/MillioMan.exe
    ```

    (Replace `netX.X` with your actual framework version.)

## ✅ Rules & Tips

- Type exact answers where needed (e.g., `USA` not `United States`).
- Number answers should be digits (e.g., `9` not `nine`).
- Pay attention to question format (True/False, number only, etc.).
- Spelling counts, but casing does not ("no" and "No" are both fine).

## 📌 To Do

- Add more questions and subjects
- Track score history or high scores
- Add lifelines (e.g., 50:50, skip)
